# Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Neural Network (DNN) 
[Live Demo](https://bank-customer-churn-prediction-using-deep-neural-networks-g92d.streamlit.app/)  

An interactive web app that predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn or stay, built using **Streamlit** and a **Deep neural network model**.

## üß© Project Overview

- **Problem**: Customer churn is a major cost for banks. If a bank can predict who might leave, they can act proactively with retention strategies.  
- **Solution**: I built a neural network model to classify customers as ‚Äúlikely to churn‚Äù or ‚Äúlikely to stay,‚Äù based on historical customer data.  
- **App**: Users can input customer attributes and instantly see the prediction (including probability) via a Streamlit dashboard.
